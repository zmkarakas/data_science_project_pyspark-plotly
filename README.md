# Data science project on 2020 Tokyo Olympics data, using Pyspark and Plotly

I have used Google Colab to do a rather small data project, based on 2021 Tokyo Olympics dataset I have grabbed from Kaggle. To view plotly graphs, simply open the project in the platform by using open in colab button, upload the kaggle.json from API section in Kaggle, this will download the sample data.
